# PostBoy project rules

## Deployment (mandatory)
- **After any code change, always run `npm run build`** so the app is built and deployed to Cloudflare Pages.
- In this project, `npm run build` = build + deploy (see package.json). There is no build-without-deploy for normal workflow.
- If you make a change and do not run build, the user will not see it live. Always run `npm run build` after editing source files.
